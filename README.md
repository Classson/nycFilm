What's Filming Where is a data visualization app that shows the number of film permits per borough and per zip code in 3 different years. The project pulls film permit numbers in the form of JSON data from NYC Open Data using SoQL queries to their api. I synthesized the film permit data with geoJSON files of each borough and zip code in NYC. I then displayed the information in maps and bar graphs using the data visualization library d3 and the frontend framework React.
